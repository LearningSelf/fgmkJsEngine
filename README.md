Engine demo
----------

Use WASD to move and IJ to interact in this demo (4MB): https://ericoporto.github.io/fgmkJsEngine/index.html

On mobile these keys will be displayed on the touch area, just hold the phone
in vertical position.

If you are in a computer, this demo is compatible with a Xbox360 gamepad, just
plug it in the usb port of your computer and you are good to go.

**NOTE:** if you clone, go into `src/` and the `index.html` doesn't run in Chrome, open with Firefox.
Chrome requires a server (I use [node http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) for loading the json files.


How does this works
-------------------

It uses a specific set of json files that are read by the engine. There is some
[description on here, in the fgmk docs](http://ericoporto.github.io/fgmk/Specification/Specification.html).
